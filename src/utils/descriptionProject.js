export const AMAZON = "'Amazon.com - Own Implementation' is the renowned e-commerce site with my own implementation of styles and events. The range of possibilities that the user has to interact with the application is very high, and I personalized each potential interaction. In principle, the user's location will be consulted, information that will be stored to show which country is being ordered from, and to show the street and city when you are about to make the purchase. The products that are shown on home and throughout the app are static, that is, the only products that exist. Each product has its rating, up to 5 stars, its price, its name, its image, and a button that say 'add to cart'. This action is not possible if you are not logged in, which at the moment can only be done by logging in with Google. Once you add a product to the cart, the number of products will be displayed in the header. There you will go to the checkout, you can remove products from the cart, and the subtotal will be displayed. The purchase is made by entering a fake card number via Stripe, the order is shown to the user, and it is stored in a Firebase database. The app is SPA, managing navigation with React Router. To find out what other technologies I used, see the CV."
export const COVID = "'Covid-19 Data In Real Time' is an information portal on the progress of the coronavirus in the world in real time. The data extracted from the disease.sh API is displayed in an attractive, compact way for easy interpretation and not to overload the user with information. It consists of a map (Open Street Map) that shows the selected information, which by default is the number of cases. You can also select the number of dead and recovered, in the latter the color of the circles changes to green. The larger the data number, the larger the circle. Each circle represents a country, you can select it, see its name, its flag for better recognition, and the data of that country. The map shows a world image by default, you can select a country in alphabetical order with the slide button that says “worldwide”. On the right, a list of the countries with the most cases of covid, ordered in descending order. And below the list a graph (chart.js) with the evolution of the covid in recent months (cases, recovered and deaths)."
export const POKEMON = "'Pokémon Search Game' is an app that consumes PokéAPI data, in order to search for pokemons and display their data. There will be no way to interact with the app if you are not logged in. The login has a username, password and its validation. The name entered will persist in the header. If you try to access any path of the app without being logged in, you will be redirected to the login. The background image represents a hypothetical game. That's why the buttons try not to be invasive, and unless you don't interact with them, the screen will stay clean. Pokémon music is available to listen and mute in a very practical and clean way. It is allowed to do an individual search, and a search of all the pokemons. The individual search allows you to enter the name of the pokemon or its number. If the search does not match any pokemon, a legend will appear to warn the user. If it matches, a card will appear with a large image of the pokémon, its description, its type, and the option to listen to the description with Speech Synthesis (if the music is on, it will pause for better listening, and will resume once the dictation is finished ). And on the other hand, the button that quotes ‘See all Pokemons’ will show a list of twenty pokemons. The 'Next' button will show the next twenty, and so on. Each pokemon shows its photo, its name, its number, its type and its ability. You can also filter the pokemons by type."
